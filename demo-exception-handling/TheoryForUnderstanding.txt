difference between checked and runtime exception in java
	Main difference between RuntimeException and checked Exception 
	
		It is mandatory to provide try-catch or try finally block to handle checked Exception and failure to do so will result in compile-time error, 
		while in case of RuntimeException this is not mandatory.
		Unchecked means compiler doesn't check and Checked means compiler checks for exception handling.

	Runtime Exception vs Checked Exception in Java
		 
	Question:
	========
	While creating custom Exception should you make them unchecked by deriving from java.lang.RuntimeException or checked? 
		well, this decision is purely yours though some thoughts are available in the Java community. 
	I mostly see JDK when in doubt and try to follow practices available in JDK. 
	Solution:
	========
		If a method is likely to fail and chances of failure is more than 50% it should throw Checked Exception to ensure alternate processing in case it failed. 
	Another thought is that programming errors should be unchecked and derived from RuntimeException e.g. java.lang.NullPointerException. Checked Exception also 
	enforces proper handling of the error condition, though it's theoretical in nature and many programs simply appease compiler by providing try catch block in-
	stead of correctly handling exception in the catch block. 

	Question
	========
		Disadvantage of checked exception:
	Solution:
	========
			One the disadvantage of checked exception over runtime exception is that it makes your code ugly by adding boilerplate code in form of try-catch-finally block. 
		Though this issue is addressed at some extent by improved Exception handling in JDK 7 by introducing automatic resource management or ARM blocks and allowing to 
		catch multiple Exception in same catch block.
